Sample Data Visualization Webapp

This webapp uses react-chart-js as a front-end with a spring boot application supplying the graphs with data.

If you would like to try this app out, pull it, build it in your ide, and run `./mvnw -e spring-boot: run` at the commandline to run the app.

The Spring boot controller is simply generating random data to supply to the chart as of right now, but something more interesting is planned for the future.
